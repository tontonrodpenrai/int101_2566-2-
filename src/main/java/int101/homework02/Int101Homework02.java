           This method receives a parameter of type "double" named "value"
           and it returns the "value" if this "value" is a positive value.
           Otherwise, it throws IllegalArgumentException.
       1.4 Create a public method named "computeIsbn10" in "Utilitor" class.
           This method recieves a parameter of type "long" named "isbn10"
